# Hack-Assembler
This project involves creating an Assembler that converts Hack assembly language code into binary machine code executable on the Hack hardware platform. The Assembler processes symbolic assembly commands and translates them into binary instructions, enabling low-level machine operations as part of the Nand2Tetris journey.
